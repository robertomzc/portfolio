Back in the 2005, when I was 11 years old, I discovered by chance a Spanish Formula 1 driver winning his second 
Formula 1 race, and becoming the first in the history of our country to lead the Drivers World Championship. 
I got quickly attached to the screen every Sunday to see if this driver, Fernando Alonso, unknown back then for most of
the spanish people, could win once again. 

What started like a mere hobby of watching races, became a increasing interest from my side into the engineering
behind those incredibly fast cars. I dreamt of working for those teams that had complicated wind tunnels, and ended up 
drawing a fake batch in which I wrote my name, the building in which I was 'working', _Aerodynamics Building_ and the team, 
_Renault F1 Team_, where Alonso had won his two world championships.

Some years later I started my BSc in Aerospace Engineering, with the objective of, one day, working in Formula 1. 
I joined the Formula Student team, since it was like working in a miniature Formula 1 team. While there, I discovered
TU Delft team, one of the best within the Formula Student Championship, team were I would end up when I started my MSc 
in Aerodynamics at the dutch university. 

The dream of working for Formula 1 was still there when an advertisement of an internship in the Renault Sport F1 Team
appeared among my university emails. The opportunity that I had been working for all these past years was in front of my 
eyes. Despite connecting to the interview one hour earlier due to the time difference between Europe and UK, the process went 
smoothly, and within some weeks I had my first professional contract, to work in a Formula 1 team, the team with which 
I saw Alonso become the world champion. I was working in those places that I had seen in documentaries years before, with 
people that I have heard of during my nerdy searches on the Internet. 

The dream had come true. The original Renault F1 Team paper batch is now accompanied by its real 
counterpart with the sentence _To not let your dreams be dreams_.
