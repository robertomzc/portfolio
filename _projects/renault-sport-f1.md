Back in the 2005, when I was 11 years old, I discovered by chance a Spanish Formula 1 driver winning his second 
Formula 1 race, and becoming the first in the history of our country to lead the Drivers World Championship. 
I got quickly attached to the screen every Sunday to see if this driver, Fernando Alonso, unknown back then for most of
the spanish people, could win once again. 

What started like a mere hobby of watching races, became an increasing interest in the engineering
behind those incredibly fast cars. I dreamt of working for those teams that had sophisticated wind tunnels, and ended up 
drawing a fake batch card in which I wrote my name, the building in which I was 'working', _Aerodynamics Building_, and the team, 
_Renault F1 Team_, where Alonso had won his two world championships.

Some years later I started my BSc in Aerospace Engineering, with the objective of, one day, working in Formula 1. 
I [joined the Formula Student team](/project/delft-formula-student-team), as it resembled a miniature F1 team.

While in the Formula Student Team Delft, an advertisement of an internship in the Renault Sport F1 Team
appeared among my university emails. The opportunity that I had been working for all these past years was in front of my 
eyes. Despite connecting to the interview one hour earlier due to the time difference between Europe and UK, the process went 
smoothly, and within some weeks I had my first professional contract, to work in a Formula 1 team, the team with which 
I saw Alonso become the world champion. I was working in those places that I had seen in documentaries years before, with 
engineers and drivers I had heard for years as a kid. The dream had come true.

The original Renault F1 Team paper batch is now accompanied by its real 
counterpart with the sentence _To not let your dreams be dreams_.
