I came accross the Ndulu English Project when travelling in south-east Asia in 2017. 
Its goal is to offer free english lessons to kids and teenagers of the Lagundri Bay
region (Pulau Nias, Sumatra) after school. In exchange, Aprianto offers surf lessons and lends
surfboards to practise on a world-class spot (now regularly part of the surfing world championships, and
with an interesting discovery story), known for its powerful and often tubular
right wave.

As a volunteer, you give in between two and three hours of classes to kids from the age of 5 
to teenagers/adults starting university. 
Furthermore, at least at the time I was there, with donors funding, Aprianto was building an actual classroom
(usually the classes will be given in Aprianto's house _terrace_), and thus we also laid a small brick
(literally) on a better environment for the kids. 

Volunteers keep going now, 7 years later, and it is possible to see their evolution and even collaborate with
them through their Facebook page.
