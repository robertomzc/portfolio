Every year, in the highschool where I spent the first 18 years of my life, one of the sports teachers
organizes a one weekend football tournament for kids, which takes the name of the school director. 

It is an occasion in which children from all around the region where I lived in Madrid come together to play, compete 
and specially have fun. Multiple sponsors support the kids with food, drinks and small gifts that they will take home
independently of their final position. Competitions of player vs goalkeeper and penalties are also included. 

Several friends from high school, and even some professional referees and players helped (and still continue to) with the 
organisation: From being referees during the games, and when not playing, help organise the _side-tournaments_,
gifts and kids and teams.
