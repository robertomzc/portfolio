reCYCLO is a volunteer-driven association dedicated to giving a second life to abandoned bicycles. The team collects these bikes and repairs them, turning what was once waste into a valuable resource for the community. This process is not just about fixing machines; it is also a hands-on learning environment where volunteers teach and learn bicycle mechanics together.

Once restored, the bicycles are rented out for long periods, promoting sustainable mobility and accessibility.

I have been volunteering at reCYCLO since 2024. My primary role involves repairing bikes to ensure they are road-ready for new users. Additionally, I assist others in repairing their own bicycles, helping to spread mechanical knowledge and self-sufficiency within the community.
