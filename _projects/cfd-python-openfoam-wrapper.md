A python wrapper developed around OpenFOAM, Pointwise and Ansys Fluent to mesh, solve and postprocess aerodynamic
simulations around small UAVs. With a easy json as entry to configure more than 30 parameters, the tool meshes 
the geometry given automatically, converts it to OpenFOAM friendly mesh, solves it using simpleFoam and postprocess the 
forces, wall shear stress etc. calculated. Batches of simulations varying angle of attack, angle of sideslip and airspeed
can also be set and simulated automatically.
