UPM Racing is the Formula Student team of the Universidad Polt√©cnica de Madrid, in which a team of students design, build
and compete with a Formula style car. I was lucky to participate during two years in the team.

During my second year, I was lucky to take the lead of the Aerodynamics and Frame department. 
Aside from the organization and managing, for the UPM13C, we made a complete redesign of many of the carbon pieces
(bodywork, wings, floor, diffuser etc.), welded a new space frame chassis with a TIG welding machine and improved 
the designs of the deposit and firewall. 

The front and rear wing design are showed as an example in the images. They were designed and optimized using XFOIL and 
ANSYS Fluent. The moulds were designed and fabricated by CAPA, one of the team sponsors, and finally they were manufactured
in carbon fiber. 

The full cycle comprised my BSc Thesis, which can be found in the link below.
