The aerodynamic designs of the UAVs at senseFly were usually validated with a windtunnel campaign.
The full test-bench, acquisition and postprocessing was built in-house, including the model in which thanks to a
central frame design, different parts can be interchanged to also evaluate the performances of different design choices
We carried out tests in different places in Europe such as TU Delft or the ETH from Zurich.
