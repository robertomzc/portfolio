There are challenges that test your body, and challenges that test your spirit. The Alpsman 2024 was both.

Inspired by the legendary Norseman triathlon, this race comprises 3.8 km of swimming in Lake Annecy starting at 5:00 AM—dropped from a boat into the dark waters, then 180 km of cycling with 4,000 meters of elevation gain through the French Alps. And finally, a 42 km run. But here's the twist: finish the first 25 km before 5:00 PM, and you earn the "privilege" of running the final 17 km in trail mode, climbing another 1,300 meters up to the Semnoz through technical mountain trails.

What made this journey truly extraordinary wasn't just the race itself—it was the months of preparation with a group of 6-7 friends who became family. We trained together through rain, heat, and exhaustion. We spent a week together in one member house near Andorra, grinding through long rides and runs, sharing meals, laughter, and the occasional doubt about what we were getting ourselves into.

One of us was my own brother. Some would do the full distance, some the half, others the Olympic distance. But we all supported each other through every session, every struggle, every small victory. Our unofficial motto, coined by one friend who sadly couldn't race due to injury, became our rallying cry: _"Sin miedo al éxito"_—"No fear to success."

On race day, jumping into the cold water at dawn felt surreal. I kept thinking about all our training sessions and the support from the group to keep me going. The bike climbs were tough and the run was long, but knowing we were all out there suffering together helped. Crossing the finish line after 15 hours was an incredible feeling—something I honestly wouldn't have thought possible a few years ago.

This is the story of the Alpsman 2024. A story that proves that with patience, motivation, discipline, and surrounded by an extraordinary group of people, everything is possible.
