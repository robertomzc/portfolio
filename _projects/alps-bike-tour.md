Four adventurers with one goal: suffering as much as possible on top of the bike to discover some of the
most iconic mountain climbs in the French Alps. Taking advantage of Kevin (one of the four) living in Grenoble, and being all 
fans of _le Tour de France_, we decided to spend four days biking non-flat terrain with the tent and sleeping
bag on the _porte-baggage_ behind the seat. Our small _Tour de France_ consisted in:

- Day 1:  _Col de la Morte_, _Col de Ornon and _Alpe d'Huez_. I never thought I would finish this day
- Day 2: _Col de la Croix de Fer_. Getting into the mood!
- Day  3: _Col du Telegraphe_ and _Col de Galibier_. Last mountain pass and where the picture was taken:
- Day 4: 70 km of flat-downish road to make it back to Grenoble. The adventure was complete and the shower well deserved


Few years later, with my brother and a better shape this time, we went back to have our revenge and 
climb _Col de la Morte_, _Col de Ornon_ (from both sides then) and _Alpe d'Huez_ with less pain on the legs.
