Aerodynamic Lab is a project dedicated to researching aerodynamics and its applications in modern transport and energy sectors. It serves as a platform to explore solutions for drag reduction and efficiency, connecting theoretical research with practical use cases.

Currently in its early phase, the project aims to grow into a resource for companies and engineering teams. The long-term vision involves providing specialized services such as high-fidelity digital twins, custom software integrations, and comprehensive testing—ranging from wind tunnel experiments to real-world validation.

It is an evolving journey to build a space where simulation and testing converge, aiming to solve complex aerodynamic problems and support the development of more efficient technologies.
