In December 2023, I decided to participate in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/), an annual event of Christmas-themed programming puzzles. The challenge consists of daily coding problems that get progressively harder as the month goes on.

Instead of sticking to languages I was comfortable with, I set myself an extra challenge: to solve the puzzles using C++. Having almost never used C++ before, this was a perfect excuse to dive into the language, explore its syntax, and understand its memory management model.

The first four days of code are hosted in the Github repository linked. Wrestling with C++ concepts while solving algorithmic puzzles was a rewarding experience that taught me a lot about the language's capabilities and complexity.
