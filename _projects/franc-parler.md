[Franc Parler](http://franc-parler.ch/) is a non-profit association dedicated to facilitating the integration of immigrants and anyone in general into Swiss culture through language learning. The association offers French classes for a symbolic sum of 20 CHF per month, making language education accessible to everyone regardless of their financial situation.
The heart of the association lies in its community of volunteer teachers who dedicate their time to helping students navigate the complexities of the French language and Swiss society.

My journey with Franc Parler began in 2024 as a student in the B2 level class, where I sought to polish my French skills and better integrate into the local community. After completing the course, with no higher level available in the association, and given the shortage of teachers I decided volunteer as an instructor for A1 level students.

Although my own French proficiency is probably not enough for teaching, the experience has been about much more than just grammar and vocabulary. I thoroughly enjoy learning alongside the students, understanding their unique backgrounds, and helping them progress in their new environment. It is a rewarding experience to contribute to their journey of adaptation and to give back to an association that provides such a great service to the community.
