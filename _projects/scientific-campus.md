The spanish government proposes during the summer a scientific camp in which some of the students with best grades in highschool, 
learn and participate during two weeks in reasearch related with science.

I was lucky to participate in the 2014 edition, at the _Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid_ (UPM) campus, which would years later be
home to my BSc studies. During this two weeks, we visited the different facilities at the university, including the IDR center 
in which sits the natural boundary layer wind tunnel. We as well perform some simple experiments with smaller windtunnels at the 
Aerospace Faculty, such as finding the distribution of pressures around a cylinder, and finally presented to all our colleagues 
the work we carried out during the week in a public presentation.
