The Spanish government proposes during the summer a scientific camp in which some of the students with best grades in high school, 
learn and participate during two weeks in research related with any STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

I was lucky to participate in the 2014 edition, at the _Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid_ (UPM) campus, which would years later be
home to my BSc studies. During this two weeks, we visited the different facilities at the university, including the [IDR center](https://www.idr.upm.es/index.php/es/) 
in which sits the university's bigger wind tunnel, among others. We as well performed some simple experiments with smaller wind tunnels at the 
Aerospace Faculty, such as finding the distribution of pressures around a cylinder.
Finally, we presented to all our colleagues the work we carried out during the week in a public presentation.
