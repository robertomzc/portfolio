UPM Racing is the Formula Student team of the Universidad Polt√©cnica de Madrid, in which a team of students design, build
and compete with a Formula style car. I was lucky to participate during two years in the team. 

During my first year, as a member of the aerodynamics and frame division, I helped with the manufacturing of multiple
carbon fiber parts, specially the bodywork (see images), and the pedalbox.
