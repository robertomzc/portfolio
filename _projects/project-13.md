Project 13 was a unique multi-sport adventure designed by a Spanish friend in Lausanne who lives for this kind of challenge. The objective was to summit the Tour d'Ai starting from Lausanne, using three different modes of transport in a single day.

The journey was a true test of endurance, consisting of:

- **Cycling**: We started by pedaling from Lausanne to Leysin, covering around 70km with more than 1,000 meters of elevation gain.
- **Hiking**: From Leysin, we hiked up another 700 meters of elevation to reach the base of the Tour d'Ai.
- **Climbing**: The final ascent involved a 4-pitch climb followed by a small alpine-style trail to reach the summit at 2,331 meters.

Unluckily for us, we picked one of the hottest days of the summer for this undertaking. Despite the heat, we made it to the top, then descended down to Aigle to catch the train back home for a well-deserved rest.

A true triathlon of the Alps that left us exhausted but incredibly alive.
