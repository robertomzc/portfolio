When living in Switzerland there are two main activities to do in winter.
Eat fondue and go to the mountains to ski or similar (see Weissmies summit) **LINK**. If the quantity of activities is rather low, their quality is outstanding. 
Some of the most beautiful landscapes and most intense adventures in this country happen in these mountains. 

Among swiss and french ski-lovers there is a particular 7-day hut-to-hut route that connects _Chamonix_
(home of the Mont Blanc on the french side) to _Zermatt_ (the Matterhorn village). On Easter 2022, Ian, 
organized the 4 day version, starting from Verbier. With the backpacks full and the skis on the feet, we 
passed through _Cabanne de MontFort_, _Cabanne de Prafleuri_ (and _Rosablanche_ peak), _Arolla_ village, and _Refuge de Bertol_,
traversing (easy and closed) glaciers, ladders and ski resorts.

For those interested, there is a race in which crazy people do the same route we did (on the reverse direction)
within a day. Its the _Patrouille de Glaciers_
