Every year, on autumn and summer, part of the Berkeley students reunite to help schools, particulars, 
hospitals etc. In my case, I was assigned, with a group of approximately 20 people, the task of cleaning 
the old and fallen wood on the proximities of an ancient-house, both for the esthetics and to avoid wildfires
propagation in the area.
